# Jump

Jump to any visible location of any visible editor quickly, using the keyboard.
Just like [avy](https://github.com/abo-abo/avy).

This package provides a single action *Jump to Char*, which you can assign a
keyboard shortcut to, under keymap settings -> Plug-ins -> Jump.

To build the plugin locally, run `./gradlew clean build`, then
build/distributions/jump-xxx.zip will be created.
It can be installed by going to the IntelliJ's plugins settings,
and choose install from disk.
